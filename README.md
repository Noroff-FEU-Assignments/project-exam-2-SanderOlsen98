# Project Exam 2
## Option 1: Real World Client

Make a website or application for a real world client. The project should offer a significant enough scope to be able to show off your skills as a developer, and hopefully the project can form a central part of your portfolio for when you start applying for jobs.

The process followed for the project will differ depending on the client and the requirements of their project.

Note: The project has to have a big enough scope to show off the skills learned over your studies. An example of the level we’re expecting would be a website where administrators can add, update, remove products, and users can search, filter, and contact administrators. If you are unsure if your potential client’s brief is strong enough for the Project Exam 2, please message your tutors. Use of a JavaScript Framework is a requirement.

If you do a Real World Client, your project will need to have the following:
Visitor side:

    Home page
    Search bar typeahead (auto dropdown to match the products or services the real world client has)
    A list of products or services either on the home page or a dedicated page
    A specific page for a product or service
    A contact form that sends a message and which can be viewed on the admin side. This can be a modal or a page.
    An enquiry page, either as a modal or separate page

Admin side:

    Login section that makes use of JWT tokens
    List of enquiries and new enquiries appear when user submits the form on the enquiry page
    List of messages from the contact form
    The admin can create a new product/service
Recommended Process

Week 1 to 3: Finding client, Planning and Design Week 4 to 6: Coding Week 7: Bug Fixing
Level 1 Process

    Use your networks and connections to find a client that needs a website or application built.
    Understand their requirements and come up with a functional specification for the project. You can write the functional specification using “System shall” statements. For example, “The system shall allow visitors to search for an article”
    Create a Gantt chart for the project, planning out your deliverables for the client.
    Make a design style guide and then take this style guide and create an Adobe XD prototype. Present to the client for feedback.
    Develop the site ensuring you deliver all that is listed in your functional specification.
    Test the website on various platforms and browsers. Ensure the site is bug-free and working before presenting to the client.
    Go through a final round of changes before going live with the website.
    Write a report on your process and decisions for the project. Please use the report template provided.
